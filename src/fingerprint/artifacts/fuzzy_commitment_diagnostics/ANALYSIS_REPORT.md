### ECC Capacity Analysis
- ECC 0.1%: INADEQUATE (0.0% success)
- ECC 0.15%: INADEQUATE (0.0% success)
- ECC 0.2%: INADEQUATE (0.0% success)
- ECC 0.25%: INADEQUATE (0.0% success)
- ECC 0.3%: INADEQUATE (0.0% success)
- ECC 0.4%: INADEQUATE (0.0% success)

### Recommendations
- QUANTIZATION [HIGH]: Quantization error too high for current ECC capacity
  Current: 8-bit
  Recommended: 10-12 bit
